Our process also allows us to engineer superior fiberglass windows that are impervious to water, cold, heat, insects, salt air and ultraviolet rays. Add to that our Lifetime Warranty with Glass Breakage and you have energy-efficient fiberglass windows that maintain their beauty in the harsh San Francisco environment.",

The outside is durable fiberglass. Compare this to conventional wood windows with their exposed wood exteriors. Not only is ours better protected on the outside, but we also have an advanced water management system that protects our wood interior and harmlessly drains away water in the rare event water enters the sash system.

Our proprietary powder-coat process (available in 15 colors) gives it a baked-on, sag-free, extremely durable exterior coating that resists scratches and gouges.",

Such problems have been on the decline, because modern vinyl is much more durable and dimensionally stable than the materials that were used 15 or 20 years ago.
